60px height +/- 30px
20px width +/- 10px


To illustrate, let's say your image's original dimensions are 2000px 
by 2000px. When the div's height is 1000px, the image's height becomes
 1000px (since it scales to the div's height). If you position a character
  at 10%/67%, this would translate to 100px (10%) and 670px (67%). 

When the div' s height increases to 1500px, the image's height becomes 
1500px, and the character's position would adjust to 10% of 1500px (which is 150px). 

As you can see, the percentage values stay the same despite the change in pixel values.
