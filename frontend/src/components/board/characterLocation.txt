Yes. 

To illustrate, let's say your image's original dimensions are 2000px 
by 2000px. When the div's height is 1000px, the image's height becomes
 1000px (since it scales to the div's height). If you position a character
  at 10%/67%, this would translate to 100px (10%) and 670px (67%). 

When the div' s height increases to 1500px, the image's height becomes 
1500px, and the character's position would adjust to 10% of 1500px (which is 150px). 

As you can see, the percentage values stay the same despite the change in pixel values.
